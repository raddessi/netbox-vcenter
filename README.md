# vCenter integration plugin for NetBox

This plugin shows live data from vCenter clusters in NetBox, making it easier for administrators to make sure that reality reflects what is documented in NetBox.

## Compatibility

This plugin in compatible with [NetBox](https://netbox.readthedocs.org/) 2.8 and later. NetBox 2.10 introduced breaking
changes that make it unusable for my own use cases, so I will not be providing support for it. There is work being done
to create a fork of NetBox that is friendlier to both network operators and contributors. My future work will be in
support of that.
